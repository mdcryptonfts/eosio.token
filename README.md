# eosio.token
Modified eosio.token contract with burn function, so you can create your own token on WAX.

This contract reduces the max supply using a burn function, instead of just reducing the circulating supply.

You can either compile/deploy it yourself, or you can use our token generator at https://waxdao.io and deploy from there for ~$10
